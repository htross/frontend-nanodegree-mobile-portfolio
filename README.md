## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.

Copy of readme.txt:

 Instructions to run app:

 1) Use a httpServer in conjunction with ngrok to test the page speed of index.html

 2) To test the framerate, open pizza.html, go to timeline under the console and hit record, scroll for 10 sec,
    stop recording, and confirm that the average frame rate is less than 60 fps.

 3) Go to the main console window. Resize the pizzas multiple times. Confirm that the log statement says that resizing
    the pizza takes less than 5ms.


 Optimizations:

 index.html initial page speed: mobile 27; desktop 90

 Steps to Optimize index.html:

 1) async the google analytics script | speed: mobile 28; desktop 91

 2) use the media = print condition for print.css | speed: mobile 28; desktop 90

 3) Download image files from internet and add them to local image directory | speed: mobile 27; desktop 91

 4) Create smaller pizzaria file pizzaria2 | speed: mobile 74; desktop 87

 5) Inline style.css | speed: mobile 75; desktop 87

 6) Remove web font (save a web call) | mobile: 87; desktop 90

 7) Lossely Compress pizzaria2 and profilePic images | mobile 93; desktop 95




 main.js 60 framerate challenge:

 1) Move var pizzasDiv = document.getElementById("randomPizzas") outside of loop. It doesn't change; don't need to get it every time

 2) Replace  phase = Math.sin((document.body.scrollTop / 1250) + (i % 5))  with  phase = Math.sin((scrollTop / 1250) + (i % 5)) (line: 506)
    Create var scrollTop = document.body.scrollTop outside of the for loop, it only needs to be computed once.

 3) 200 pizzas can not be displayed on the screen at one time. Reducing the number of pizzas improves the frame rate because
    fewer pizzas have to move each time the user scrolls


 Resize pizza in under 5ms:

 1) Refactor code in changePizzaSizes(size) function. Bring calculation of offsetWidth for the randomPizzaContainer class and the
    randomPizzas id outside of the loop. These values are consistent for each pizza, so removing them from the loop saves unnecessary
    computation.
